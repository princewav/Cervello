# The Happiness Track by Emma Seppälä (Book Summary) - NJlifehacks

## 1. Hustling, Grinding, and Chasing the Future Doesn’t Work
- Problema: Rincorri sempre la prossima task prima di finire quella corrente. La tua mente è sempre ossessionata dal lavoro. Ti ritrovi spesso a chiederti cosa dovresti in questo momento per avere più successo.
- Questi comportamenti possono essere dannosi in vari ambiti:
    - Salute: sono associati al burnout, esaurimento emotivo, cinismo e depersonalizzazione
    - Lavoro: aumenta lo stress e insoddisfazione sul lavoro, riducendo la produttivià a seguito del calo di attenzione. Pensando alla prossima task si sottrae attenzione a quella corrente.
    - Relazioni: questà competitività danneggia i rapporti con i colleghi e favorisce commportamenti controprodicenti, oltre a diminuire la soddisfazione familiare.

## 2. The Benefits of Being Present
- **Essere presenti rende più produttivi**. Il multitasking non funziona, al contrario dell'immergersi completamente nella task corrente.
- **Essere presenti rende più felici**. Una mente che rimugina è infelice. Una mente immersa appieno in un'attività, invece, ce la fa godere, per quanto sia noiosa.
- **Essere presenti ci rende carismatici**. Fa molto più colpo una persona che dà piene attenzioni ed è convolta attivamente nella conversazione, piuttosto che una distratta, con sguardo perso nel vuoto.

## 3. How to Bring Your Mind Into the Present
- Visto che siamo sempre persi nei nostri pensieri e ci teniamo sempre occupati non diamo attenzione al momento presente
- Non sempre riusciamo ad accorgerci che ci stiamo alienando, ma con la meditazione possiamo allenare questa consapevolezza.
- Quando ci se ne rende conto, non bisogna incolparsi per essersi distratti. Invece, bisogna riportare con tranquillità e rapidità la propria mente al momento presente.
- Essere presenti significa vivere appieno l'esperienza, essere completamente vigile, dare attenzione a ciò che succede.

## 4. Multitasking Is a Bad Idea
- Tendiamo a riempire ogni nostro momento libero con il multitasking
- Il multitasking danneggia la concentrazione e crea danni alla salute, con ansia e depressione.
- Al contrario l'essere concentrato in una singola task ci assorbe in uno stato di completa concentrazione. Ci capita quando siamo costretti da una deadline a lavorare su un progetto per esempio, in cui siamo impossibilitati a distogliere la concentrazione.

## 5. The #1 Way to Learn the Art of Presence?
- La meditazione migliora:
    - Salute: diminuisce il dolore e aumenta le funzioni immunitarie
    - Cervello: aumenta le aree legate alla regolazione dell'autocontrollo e dell'attenzione
    - Felicità: diminuisce ansia e stress
    - Vita sociale: aumenta la connessione sociale e l'intelligenza emotiva
    - Produttività: aumenta la memoria e la capacità di pensare fuori dagli schemi

## 6. Calmness Is the Key to Effortless Self-Control

> “We exercise self-control countless times during a regular workday (and in the evenings too!), and it’s exhausting us. When we experience high-intensity emotions like excitement or stress, we need extra self-control, because physiological arousal adds one more element to control. For example, your heart is pounding with anxiety over a presentation you have to make, and then you have to exert control not only over your words as you deliver your message, but also over your body so that you don’t stutter or lose your train of thought.

> Calm states are the key to effortless self-control. Staying calm helps you be present with the task in which you are engaged, making it easier to avoid distractions. Paying attention happens naturally without any need for self-control.”

Self-Control matters. As we’ve mentioned multiple times in our articles, it’s literally the #1 predictor of happiness, health, wealth, and overall success in life.

And calmness, it turns out, is the key to effortless self-control.

Why is that? It’s because the physiology of calm and the physiology of self-control go very well together. In fact, they are one and the same. When you’re calm, heart rate variability is maximized, your limbic system is minimally activated, and the prefrontal cortex (the seat of willpower) is fully online.

When you’re aroused through high-intensity positive emotions (e.g., excitement) or more likely through high-intensity negative emotions (e.g., anger or anxiety), your physiology shifts into a more impulsive and primitive state. Heart rate variability goes down, the limbic system goes into overdrive, and the prefrontal cortex goes offline. Goodbye willpower!

The point is, feeling calm is the optimal state for self-control. And self-control is incredibly important for living a happy, healthy, and successful life.

So, how do you cultivate this state of calmness? So that it becomes more automatic and natural in your life? Basically, anything that activates your parasympathetic nervous system will do the job. This involves activities such as meditation, yoga, tai chi, stretching classes, or relaxation exercises.

In addition to that, it helps to learn how to manage stress in your life. Stress – whether emotional or physical – activates the sympathetic nervous system and tends to take you out of a state of calmness. Guess what the best stress management strategies are? Meditation, yoga, Tai Chi, stretching, relaxation exercises… so yeah, just get started with meditation already.

Oh, and one other way to activate the parasympathetic nervous system and cultivate a state of calm is the practice of breathing…

(Learn more about willpower in our summaries of [_The Willpower Instinct_](https://www.njlifehacks.com/willpower-instinct-kelly-mcgonigal-summary/) by Kelly McGonigal or [_Willpower_](https://www.njlifehacks.com/willpower-roy-baumeister-summary/) by Roy Baumeister and John Tierney.)

## 7. The Power of Breathing

> “According to Stephen Porges, professor at the University of North Carolina and distinguished university scientist at Indiana University Bloomington, one reason slow breathing has an immediate effect is that it activates the vagus nerve—the tenth cranial nerve, which is linked to our heart, lungs, and digestive system—and thus slows down the sympathetic (fight-or-flight) and adrenal systems. In so doing, it rapidly calms us down. And with a calm mind, we handle situations more effectively. Porges explains that abdominal breathing—using the diaphragm—is particularly beneficial, as are lengthened exhales. Exhales slow the heart rate; the longer we spend on the outbreath, the more the nervous systems relaxes. In this way, exhales activate our parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) system, coaxing greater relaxation into our bodies and minds and helping us feel more peaceful. By controlling your breathing, you can use a voluntary mechanical behavior to make a profound change on your state of mind.

> So what does that mean for us? We can use our breath whenever we experience a stressful event. It is an incredible tool that is accessible to you anytime and anywhere—whether it is in an interview you are nervous about, an interaction that is upsetting, or a big public talk.”

What’s the fastest way to change your state of mind? What’s the fastest way to switch your body from sympathetic dominance into a more calm and relaxed state?

Your breath.

One to two minutes of slow and deep breathing can do wonders if you’re feeling stressed, agitated, or overwhelmed.

And by slowing down your mind and body, it puts you back into that state of effortless self-control. In fact, Kelly McGonigal, an expert in all things willpower, mentions in her book [_The Willpower Instinct_](https://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Instinct-Self-Control-Works-Matters-ebook/dp/B005ERIRZE/) that the breath is pretty much the only quick fix to more self-control.

So, next time you’re in need of some willpower or are feeling stressed out, just take a moment or two to slow down your breathing to four to six breaths a minute. For example, try breathing in to a count of four and breathing out to a count of eight.

Oh, and while we’re talking about stress, next up is something you want to avoid…

## 8. Toughing It Out Doesn’t Work

> “When we feel anxious and can’t talk our way out of stressful thoughts, we often end up suppressing emotions. We put on a poker face and ‘suck it up.’ Research by Stanford psychologist James Gross demonstrates that attempting to suppress emotions (by not showing our emotion) leads to the opposite of what we want. By trying to hide emotions, we actually manifest them more strongly physiologically. For example, anger or stress increase the heart rate and make your palms sweat. Suppressing these emotions increases their physiological impact. In fact, it even impacts the physiology of whoever you are talking with by raising their heart level! Suppressing negative emotions on a regular basis actually makes people experience more negative emotions and less positive emotions. Individuals who tend to suppress have lower self-esteem, optimism, and well-being and higher rates of depression as well as impaired memory. Suppression negatively impacts their relationships and social life.”

Ouch!

This research comes out of a field called _emotion regulation_. I learned about it in the great book [_Your Brain at Work_](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Brain-Work-Strategies-Distraction-ebook/dp/B002Q1YE3K/) by David Rock. Researchers in this field have found that negative emotions can have a detrimental effect on our health, performance, and general well-being and they’re trying to figure out how best to deal with those negative emotions.

One way of dealing with them is suppression – as we just learned, a bad idea. So, what should you do next time you’re feeling angry, sad, anxious, or otherwise bad? There are several strategies that work, but the easiest one is to just label the feeling.

You just say to yourself, “Oh, that’s anger.” Or, “Oh, I’m feeling a bit sad.”

You label the negative emotion. While this may not sound very helpful, it actually is. The reason it works is because it creates a distance between you and the emotion. You’re not so identified with it anymore and thus less reactive to it. In addition to that, labeling emotions has been shown to activate the prefrontal cortex – the seat of your willpower and other cognitive processes.

I can’t go into details here. But next time you’re experiencing negative emotions, don’t try to suppress them – it doesn’t work, anyway. Instead, accept them and put a label on them. And then go about your normal life.

## 9. Practice Gratitude to Boost Well-Being and Strengthen Professional Skills

> “Research supports the idea that gratitude has tremendous benefits; gratitude not only boosts your well-being but also significantly strengthens professional skills.

> Grater physiological well-being and health: improved positive emotion, longer-lasting positive emotion, buffering against stress and negativity, decreased anxiety and depression, reduced materialism (and materialism is linked to lower levels of well-being), improved sleep quality and duration, in part because you have more grateful thoughts before you go to sleep.

> Improved professional skills: higher social intelligence, improved relationships, likeability (gratitude makes you a kinder, more altruistic, moral, and ethical person), strengthened willpower, better long-term decision making, increased positive influence on others, who become more ethical and act with greater integrity and greater kindness.”

Some people call gratitude the most powerful human emotion that exists. Whether that’s true or not is debatable. The fact that it _is_ indeed powerful and highly beneficial is not.

Check out Robert Emmons’ book [_Thanks!_](https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Practicing-Gratitude-Make-Happier/dp/0547085737/) (summary [here](https://www.njlifehacks.com/thanks-robert-emmons-book-summary/)) to find out more about the science of gratitude and how to apply it in your own life. The easiest way to get started with cultivating more gratitude in your life is to keep a so-called gratitude journal, in which you write down 3-5 things you’re grateful for every day. Yup, that’s all it takes!

## 10. Self-Compassion, NOT Self-Criticism Helps You Thrive

We talked about success myths at the beginning of this article. Here’s another common one: You need to be critical of yourself and push yourself hard to reach high levels of success.

The research shows something else:

> “Self-compassion – as opposed to self-criticism – helps people thrive and is associated with a host of benefits:

-   Greater psychological well-being
-   Less anxiety, depression, and stress
-   More happiness, optimism, curiosity, creativity, and positive emotions
-   Better health
-   Lower cellular inflammation in response to stress
-   Reduced cortisol (a stress-related hormone)
-   Increased heart rate variability, a physiological marker associated with the ability to bounce back faster from stressful situations
-   Improved professional and personal skills
-   Stronger motivation
-   Better relationships with other people
-   Reduced fear of failure and greater willingness to try again
-   Enhanced willpower
-   Greater perspective and reduced tendency to become overwhelmed during times of struggle

I’ve written about this stuff countless times. If you want greater happiness and success, you need to let go of self-criticism and choose self-compassion.

To get started, I suggest checking out some of my articles on the topic. [Here](https://www.njlifehacks.com/self-compassion-versus-self-criticism/)'s one explaining why self-compassion makes you more successful than self-criticism. [Here](https://www.njlifehacks.com/self-compassion-self-criticism-procrastination/)'s one on how self-compassion helps us overcome procrastination. And [here](https://www.njlifehacks.com/self-compassion-kristin-neff/)'s a book summary of Kristin Neff's book of the same title.
