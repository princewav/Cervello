No. 1 Life is Unfair: Did you think you were born into a world that makes sense? No, no you aren’t. But it’s not supposed to be any other way. Bad things can happen to really good people just as good things can happen to bad people, and you would wail at the unfairness of it all. But eventually, you’ll have to take a deep breath, and realize that it’s not about good people or bad people, it’s about things, they just happen. Bill Gates said, “Life isn’t fair, get used to it” 

No. 2 No one cares about your life: Did you buy new clothes or get a new car? Nobody actually cares. They may be curious for a few weeks but that’s it, they move on. Don’t base your happiness on people’s caring, because they don’t. And if they do, they either want your stuff, or hate you for it. No one cares about your life, so live to please yourself and not others. 

No. 3 You matter Don’t see yourself as an insignificant part of the 7.5 billion world’s people. In fact, you’re as important as everybody else put together because you can change the world. Don’t wait for a near death experience to realize this, and do things knowing that everything about you matters. What you think, what you do matters; don’t let anyone else convince you otherwise. You’re not just one of us, you’re an important pillar among us because you can change our history. 

No. 4 Unexpected happen, prepare for them. Sometimes your meticulous plans could go up in smoke, but if you live life with no backup plans, you will be subject to life’s whims. Life is ups and downs. Take risks but have a backup. Do what you need to in order to be stable always. Prepare for the unexpected. 

No. 5 Market don’t care about your degrees Forget your Harvard degrees, nobody cares. Forget your P.HD. No one cares either. Employers and market only pays for your value which is equal to the amount of solution you can create. Don’t focus on the papers. Focus on being a better, more valuable person. 

No. 6 Your true friends rarely come after you succeed When you’re a nobody, you’ll have just a few people around you. When you become famous or successful, a million people will become your “friends”. Don’t be deceived by this. Only very few people truly love you. 	

No. 7 You alone are Responsible for Yourself: If you think you can live life letting someone else determine your success or happiness, think again. Nobody else will find success for you, and nobody else will give you happiness. Neither your parents, nor the government can make you a success. That’s on you. 

No. 8 Your friends are as important as your parents: Your parents influence a lot of things about your life and that’s understandable because they gave birth to you, but your friends will influence you as much as your parents and even sometime more. Beware of who you hang around Rachel Wolchin said, “Surround yourself with people that reflect whom you want to be and how you want to feel, energies are contagious.”

No. 9 There are no shortcuts in life: Most young people want to get anything they desire NOW, today. Well, life isn’t that cheap or else everyone would have become successful. Understanding that there are no shortcuts in life and that you need to pay the price to get where you want to be is very important or else you’ll get nothing out of life. 

No. 10 Debts is poisonous: It’s easy to spend the money you don’t have, to buy things you don’t need, but burdensome to pay back the money you spend on foolish stuff. Instead of wallowing in credit, why don’t you try using real money and buy only stuff you need? You’ll realize that your financial stress goes down. Debt is poisonous, except you use it to create wealth. 

No. 11 You’ll be tempted to waste time dwelling on the past: Life is complex and a lot of things happen. However, most life’s failure is as a result of dwelling on the past. Don’t fall for this temptation. Your background, your parents’ poverty, what someone told you last year. Those are the past. Don’t allow them to affect your tomorrow. Denis Waitley said: “Don’t dwell on what went wrong. Instead, focus on what to do next. Spend your energies on moving forward towards finding the answer”

No. 12 You’ll fail, anyway. Life and failure are inseparable. To avoid failure is never to be born. After your birth, the only two things that are certain are failures and death. What most people do is to avoid mistakes and failures as much as possible, until they can no longer run away and they’ll then experience the real failure at their old age. Don’t take life easy. Don’t run to a save zone. Face your fear, voluntarily fail when you’re young so that you won’t fail later in your life 

No. 13 If you don’t love yourself, you can’t love no one: You cannot love others if you do not love yourself. In fact, no one will love you except you love yourself. Your relationship with yourself will determine the type of relationship you will have with others. Before you seek to be loved, love thyself first. Lucille Ball said, “Love yourself first and everything else falls in line”

No. 14 “Thank you” and “I am sorry” are two important statements to go far in life: We hurt people around us every day. We receive helps and gifts from people who care about us every now and then, learning to say “I am sorry” when you hurt someone and “thank you” when someone does something great to you are habits you need to master to navigate successfully through life. 

No. 15. Trust people’s actions and not words: Andrew Carnegie said, “The older I get the less I listen to what people say. I pay attention to what they do instead”. People’s words are deceptive. Learn to watch what they do, not what they say. 

No.16. Nothing lasts for long: Your friendship with people, your youthfulness, your health, unfortunately, they are all temporal things. When you realize that NOTHING in this life is permanent, then you will look at life in a different way. Knowing that all the people you love and the things you own will someday be gone will enable you to value life more. 

No. 17. Your health is far more important than you think: Until you lose it, you may not appreciate your health. Pursue money and success but remember your health too. Exercise and healthy eating are very important for your general wellbeing. What you eat affects the way you look and feel. Limit frequent visits to the doctor by making sure that healthy foods and some physical activity are a part of your daily life. 

No. 18. Challenges and difficulties are a part of life: Realizing that challenges are bound to happen and that everyone goes through them will help you focus more on the solutions to those challenges. 

No. 19 You’ll be forsaken when you need people most If everything is fine with you, you’ll have many friends, if you’re very successful you’ll have a million friends but don’t be deceived. If life knocks you down, just at the time you think you need people most, if you find a single friend around you, you’re lucky. That’s life. There’s nothing you can do about it. Just prepare for it. 

No. 20 Do not be scared of change: Change they say is the only constant thing in life. If a relationship, a job or just about anything is stressing you out and making you miserable, cut them off. You shouldn’t live your life with the fear that you wouldn’t find something better. Embrace change and move from negativity. 

No. 21 You won’t live for long Sorry to tell you this but it’s true. 90 years isn’t that long. 100 years isn’t that a long time. If you want to leave a significant mark here, you have to be in a hurry. Stop wasting time. Focus on only important things because your days are few.
