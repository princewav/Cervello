[5 things you need to know in your 20s](https://youtu.be/Xg73i7DjLlU)

gentleman's game here today we're gonna do something a little bit different it was actually my birthday a few weeks ago and the week leading up to my birthday I took time to reflect on how I've navigated my 20s so far things I wish I could have done differently things I wish I didn't waste so much time on etc so I felt inspired to share five of the most important lessons I've learned so far in my 20s these are things I wish someone had told me when I was 19 or 20 about to enter a real adulthood so hopefully for the younger viewers or viewers in your early 20s you can pick up something useful from this video to apply to your own life before we start though make sure to check out my free 5 page PDF on the fundamentals of Attraction in the description box below if you haven't done so yet alright let's begin number 1 an abundance of time and options when you're in your 20s you will never have more free time in your life than you do right now chances are you most likely don't have a kid yet or a mortgage to pay off you might have a job that you need to devote eight hours to everyday but once you're off the clock you probably have lots of free time or at least lots of free time relative to how little time you'll have in your 30s and 40s I want you to think of time as a river you know sounds like a cheesy Eastern proverb but it's a good analogy when you're born you start out by the shore ready to sail into the waters and as you go through school and learn how to make friends and be social you're starting to venture out into the waters a bit more as the flow of the river pushes you further and further away from the shore and eventually when you're in your 20s you're at a very unique spot in the river you know it's too far from the shore that you can't swim back and the river's current is only pushing you further and further away but you're still very very far away from the end of the river so you have the decision of how you're going to sell your boat right like which direction you want to swim towards for the remainder of your life thing is when you're in your 20s you have so much time again you will probably never have as much time and energy as you do now so take advantage of it how do you want to set yourself up for the rest of your life right what skills do you want to learn you know what kind of a dating life do you want what countries do you want to visit before you die all of these are questions you need to reflect on and then direct your time and energy into solving when you're this young the options are truly endless right it's like that quote you can do anything but not everything so take advantage of your abundance of time and gain experiences if there's a time in your life to be selfish it's now in your 20s number two take more risks and l's if there's one thing I'm really grateful I did in my early 20s it was that I took lots and lots of L's or losses I lost tens of thousands of dollars trying to build my first two businesses I worked at miserable soul-crushing jobs for years after school before finding my path I would go to clubs with my buddies and sometimes I not only get rejected by girls but I'd get completely embarrassed like I remember one time this girl literally gave me a look like you're kidding right before she sipped her drink and just walked away those rejections those l's hurt so much at the time I'd feel defeated frustrated like was it even worth going out to improve my game if it was gonna suck this much was it worth taking these painful rejections and having my self-esteem obliterated the next morning I'd wake up look at myself in the mirror and ask these tough questions but almost always my answer was yes yes it was worth taking all these risks all these Elle's because it made me tougher it made me more resilient to adversity and looking back that was probably the single greatest decision I made because through those early experiences of taking lots of risks lots of losses you'll learn to stop fearing failure and once you stop being scared to fail you gained a certain sense of freedom the freedom of actually learning for learnings sake not just trying to avoid failure there's a great book I actually read about this failing forward by John C Maxwell basically in the book he talks about how when you take risks and fail you have one of two choices you can there take the failure personally like you're inherently just not good enough making you discouraged from trying again in the future or you can choose a second option which is to choose to interpret your failure as an opportunity for growth seeing where you need to work on etc going back to the same example as before when I get a rejection from a girl these days which will still happen by the way no matter how good you become I brush it off easily I learned to even find the humor in it like damn that girl just shut me down okay you know it's alright her boyfriend would have liked that anyways if I made out with her and then I just move on to the next one the next shot the next project or the next whatever that you're scared to fail at so don't be scared to take more risks do things that take you out of your comfort zone things where you'll likely fail at times but it's still so worth it in the end once you evolve into a better you number three not everyone is going to like you from childhood through your teenage years you're taught how to get along with people you know you work on group projects form study groups join extracurricular organizations maybe learn how to work your first job and be an obedient employee during these formative years you're encouraged to avoid confrontation when a bully tries to bother you in school you probably call on the teacher to take care of it instead of handling it yourself for example but once you become a grown adult you quickly realize that you're gonna have to learn how to deal with difficult people because not everyone is gonna be reasonable not everyone is gonna like you and if you maintain that childlike desire to please everyone and avoid confrontation you will be taken advantage of in some way it's inevitable because there are some real jerks out there and that's completely fine because you're not gonna like everyone back what you need to learn to do in these scenarios whether at work or at a social event when you bump into some unsavory people who don't like you is to stop caring what they think about you right there's another book I read about this called The Four Agreements right one of the principles the author teaches is to stop taking things personally basically when someone acts like a dick to you it has more to do with their own issues rather than something wrong with you right some people are just unpleasant so stop caring what they think about you and stop trying to please everyone it's corny to say but be yourself be comfortable with who you are whoever likes you will like you for you and those that don't like you won't that is life number four go out as much as possible when you're in your 20s there's never again going to be a time in your life where you'll have as much energy time and motivation to go out and meet people the sad reality is the older you get the less you're gonna go out it'll be harder and harder for you and your friends to get together as they get married have kids and buy a house your 20s are the time in your life where you can go out the most not that you can't go out in your 30s and beyond anyone who wants to improve in this aspect of their life still can you know but generally it just isn't the same when you're older so enjoy it while it lasts also another reason I suggest to go out as much as possible in your 20s is because it's the best time to actually learn how to be comfortable and natural in these types of environments a lot of my viewers tell me that they have some form of social anxiety well the best way to overcome social anxiety is simply through exposing yourself to those sorts of social situations and to slowly desensitize yourself to the anxiety or those feelings of awkwardness so if you do have social anxiety you're gonna benefit so much more from learning to overcome that in your 20s so that you'll have the rest of your life to reap the benefits of learning those social skills on the other hand if you have social anxiety and you put off trying to overcome it until your 30s it's only gonna be harder and harder to do so as you get older and your brain gets more set in its ways and when you do finally overcome social anxiety in your 30s you'll have less time to actually reap the benefits so don't put this off go out as much as possible in your 20s take social risks and learn to strike a conversation with a stranger I'm not saying you have to go out every night but once or twice a week is good you'll be thanking yourself that you did and you'll look back fondly on those years with nostalgia when older number-5 move out look I get that Millennials live with their parents on average way more compared to older generations and you can blame this on a bunch of different reasons buying a house is more expensive than ever the increase in salaries hasn't kept up with inflation the student loan debt trap can feel like a shackle around your ankle and so on and so forth but with that being said I still can't emphasize enough how important it is to experience living on your own at some point in your 20s this is the age when you're supposed to learn how to be truly independent to be self-sufficient truth is women just aren't attracted to a 35 year old man still living in his mother's basement it's alright for a while but at some point you need to be your own man I mean think about it let's say you end up having the most amazing night out meeting a beautiful girl who's super into you down to come over and have fun and then you take her back to your parents house not exactly a turn-on for her in my personal opinion I think it's fine to stay at home until 25 or 26 I actually didn't move out until I was 24 but forcing yourself to find a way to survive on your own will be a powerful growth experience it'll be stressful at times there might be moments when you're questioning yourself if you made the right choice if you should stick with it and learn to deal with the responsibility of living on your own or move back in with your parents so that you can save some money and let them take care of you but I promise that the lessons and life experiences you'll gain from moving out and being your own man or woman will transform you into a tougher more resilient more resourceful and overall more mature and capable adults if you put yourself in a situation where you don't get a chance to learn these skills until your 30s the reality is by then you'll be behind the curve compared to your peers so to summarize today we talked about five things you need to know in your 20s which are number one taking advantage of how much time and options you have number two taking more risks and l's number three not everyone is gonna like you number four go out as much as possible and number five move out and be in the tendance if you enjoyed this video do me a favor and give it a thumbs up next week we'll be talking about types of women you should avoid so make sure to subscribe and hit
