### **2. What is Sloww?**

**At its highest level:**

Sloww is creating the **web’s deepest guide to the art of living** by synthesizing the **world’s wisdom on human potential** through an **interdisciplinary study** across **diverse yet interconnected disciplines**.

**Here’s what Sloww values in a nutshell:**

Sloww supports **slowing down** in a fast world because slowing down is the gateway to all things good—which aren’t _things_ at all.

Sloww encourages **lighter living** because _more_ hasn’t added to our lives—we must subtract the superficial “stuff” (physical clutter _and_ mental-emotional clutter) and shift inward where we can meet life face-to-face.

Sloww promotes finding **higher purpose** because there’s nothing more essential than meaning in life but no one taught us _how to find it_—we are currently in the midst of a collective meaning crisis.

Sloww synthesizes the timeless **art of living** for our modern world because we aren’t taught _how to live_ in school or the workplace—how to be conscious and holistic humans who awaken and actualize our full potential and live fully alive.
