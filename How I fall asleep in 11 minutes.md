# How I fall asleep in 11 minutes - 5 techniques I use to fall asleep faster

- Mettere il filtro della luce blu almeno due ore prima di andare a dormire
- stare a letto circa un ora prima rispetto alla quantità di ore che si vuole dormire. Es se voglio svegliarmi alle 8 devo andare a letto per le 11
- fare almeno un ora di esercizio prima di andare a dormire. bisogna sentirisi stanchi per dormire con più facilità, se si va a dormire attivi vuol dire che dobbiamo fare più fatica, più attività, altrimenti si fa fatica ad addormentarsi e ci si sveglia stanchi

 so in this video i'm going to give you a couple of tactics and ideas and techniques on how i managed to fall asleep on average in just 11 minutes and that's data from over 300 nights of sleep anyone who has been around me whilst i fall asleep has usually been jealous and i'm not gonna give you the same basic advice that i see youtubers give like oh make a rule no screens one hour before bed because it's just although the advice is good it's just too generic and i honestly use my screens my phone and my computer till the minute that i go to bed so straight away rule number one technique one is use the screens but put on the blue light filter so this makes the screen go really red and orange put it onto the max around a few hours before you go to sleep so for me i turn mine on around six to seven pm and i put it on max some people say that oh it's annoying they don't want this screen to look like that but then you're literally just messing up your sleep to not do that so just use that feature it's on most phones it's on iphones it's on macbooks it's on even windows pcs and so with this blue light filter this nighttime filter you can still use your screens before you go to bed and i know for a lot of people that is almost a requirement to sleep all right secondly no one is sleeping long enough people who are sure that they're sleeping for eight hours are incorrect now let me ask you a question you want to wake up at 6 00 am and you want eight hours of sleep what time do you go to bed it's simple maths everyone will say 10 pm everyone is wrong the correct answer is around nine maybe even half eight no one said they want eight hours of lying down of bedtime no it's eight hours of sleep and and even me even someone who considers themselves to be like an expert sleeper it takes me 11 minutes on average to fall asleep so technically i would need to go to bed at 9 49 not 10 p.m and even then that is assuming that i hit my perfect average sleeping time and then don't even wake up for a single second during the night which is obviously still unrealistic so i want to wake up at 6 30 6 30 a.m is my daily wake-up time what time do i go to sleep i want 8 hours 10 30 no 9 30. 9 30 i'm in bed and i've even just changed this last night i have made this even more drastic i am now waking up at 7 00 a.m and i'm gonna get into bed at 9pm that's 10 hours i'm dedicating to sleep and i just checked my data and i'll show you as well even though i set aside 10 hours for this i was only asleep for 8 hours and 20 minutes just think about that i set aside 10 hours for bedtime and i was only asleep for 8 hours and 20 or something close to that level that makes you wonder all of the people who are setting aside eight hours how little sleep are they actually getting my guess would be about six and a half hours because i think most people toss and turn and go on their phone even in bed so even though they're in bed at 10 pm they haven't stopped scrolling on their phone until half 10 11. setting aside a longer time for your sleep block is probably one of the best little techniques that you can take away you want eight hours so set aside nine to ten and finally if you're an active person which you should be if you're watching my videos on self-improvement then you must be an active person i cannot emphasize the importance of exercise enough every single day you can do a form of exercise if you've been doing incredible amounts of strenuous exercise then yeah one day off a week is pretty good but other than that you can do a form of exercise every single day you want to sleep better you need to be tired when you go to sleep the amount of people who tell me that they're not tired when they go to sleep but they're tired when they wake up like that's normal now that like normal people wake up and they still feel tired and they go to bed feeling like wide awake and they don't want to go to sleep yet that's normal take a second to think about how weird that is that that is normal that is what's average and if you feel like that if you if this is what you experience you wake up tired and you go to bed awake honestly shame on you like you have prioritized the wrong things completely i think sleep is one of those things that if you are not prioritizing it's your own loss everything that you can think of that is like a downside to humans a lack of sleep will do everything that you can think of which is like a positive for humans good sleep will do and we can even go far to say like it will make you good sleep will literally make you more attractive will make you more money bad sleep will make you literally make you more ugly and it will make you poorer it will make you less educated with everything you can think of your brain power is just going to be worse if you're not prioritizing your sleep so honestly shame on you if you wake up tired and you go to sleep like awake and you're kind of annoyed that you're so awake at night time that's because you have not put in enough effort into your sleep if you're watching my channel you're into self-improvement you're trying to better your life this is where you start this is where you start you have to prioritize sleep i feel like the majority of people who are having bad sleep are ones who do not exercise you must be tired when you go to bed it should be obvious like you've just done a hard day's work right so you should be tired but a hard day's work doesn't just mean you went to your full-time job and then came home and watched netflix for like three hours before bedtime it means you went to your job came home exercise for an hour and then watch netflix for like one and a half hours and watch how nicely you'll fall asleep then you'll be grateful to rest your shoulders on your bed when your muscles are sore your bed even the most uncomfortable bed feels like a cloud it feels so nice to rest your sh like your sore shoulders and your chest and your back on a bed just on anything it just feels nice to lie down after you've just worked your body out and if you feel wide awake when you're going to sleep and you're not even tired that means that you haven't done enough for yourself and even you might feel like you've done so much you've been to school and you came home and you did an extra hour of homework and maybe you even exercised enough but it honestly is probably not enough compared to your own capabilities you should be tired when you lie down at the end of a whole day if you're not just don't take this as an insult but i think even take this as a compliment that means that you can do more and maybe you don't want to do more but you've got the capacity to do more because you still had energy at the end of the day you go to sleep at the end of the day when you have no energy to refresh recharge your energy if at your bedtime 10 p.m you don't need to recharge your energy and you still feel wide awake and you've got some energy then clearly you didn't expend all your energy in the day it's common sense but a lot of people just don't put the links together so here is the practical advice if you're having poor sleep right now and you find it difficult to get to sleep fast enough implement these things number one use the night light filter on your devices that you use before going to sleep and make sure you set this so that it comes on at least two to three hours before your bedtime number two extend your bedtime make your bedtime longer if you only set aside eight hours for bedtime you will not get eight hours of sleep you want eight hours of sleep set aside nine hours for bedtime yes that means you need to go to sleep earlier and then everyone will say wait wait but i can't go to sleep earlier i'm not tired okay you're not tired when you go to sleep and you're tired when you wake up do things in the day that make you tired right now whatever you're doing is not working right so you have to do something new so stop having the same day as always stop being sat down for three hours before bedtime or six hours before bedtime just watching your screen with all the blue light hitting your face and instead exercise tire your body out when you finally lie down if you should feel good about lying down you should like literally want to lie down at about 9 p.m if your body's tired you will do and that also goes for your mind if your mind is tired and you've done a good amount of work and you feel like strenuous and a bit stressed you'll fall asleep easier that's about it i think there's three things that i do that most of the people who ask me for advice on sleep don't do so now i'm gonna have both of my playlists physical health and mental health both of these have got knowledge that will help you sleep better physical health will tire you out physically more and better mental health will of course help you in living all of life but when you've got better mental health and less thoughts and you're not like daydreaming and you're not deep in thought about something important you're obviously going to sleep better so you can get more knowledge from these that's it that's how i fall asleep in 11 minutes on average take care all right i actually have two more bonus techniques to improve your sleeping to fall asleep faster i actually forgot to mention these because of how normal they have become in my life it's just become a normal part of my night routine that i completely just forgot that this isn't something that most other people do i remember reading a study a while ago i don't think i'm probably not going to bother trying to find it so just try and trust me or at least try this for yourself essentially the tactic was to journal just before going to bed they experimented the different types of journaling to see what would help you fall asleep faster or have better sleep and the one type of journaling that did help wasn't gratitude journaling or deep journaling it was simply a checkbox it was simply a to-do list so it was literally just planning the things to do tomorrow and so i did this for about a year straight using my iphone on just the basic notes app you can add like a little circle check whatever it is and i would literally just have it as wake up go to the toilet check my weight go to the gym you know everything that i wanted to do step by step by step by step by step go to university do my lecture do this extra work do this go and meet someone eat this food that i everything that you could think of when you do it step by step like that you essentially take those thoughts out of your mind at least for me what i found was that when you have that on paper or just written out on your phone then that stuff that plan that to-do list is not in your head and that's actually very powerful because i think for most people who are planning their day out they would probably do it when they're going to sleep so they're planning what to do tomorrow what when they're going to wake up what they're going to do first thing oh i need to i need to go and speak to someone i need to send that email i need to read that letter i need to do this and that if that's in your head it's going to stop you from falling asleep so write it down and then it's out of your head in paper and you know that you just do not have to think about those things anymore so that was technique number one so i used that technique for a very long time and now there's one other thing that i have done since i don't even know i've i had this video edited and uploaded ready to be uploaded on friday so that that is literally today and i thought you know what i'm going to take off the uploaded version it's private right now i'm going to take off and upload this technique as well because this is something i've been doing since i was probably about 10 11 years old and it is the quickest most reliable way to fall asleep when you go to when you're going to sleep when you're in bed lying down probably one of the best questions to ask is what should i be thinking about because there are definitely some things that if if you think about them you will fall asleep faster and there's a lot of things that if you think about them you will fall asleep slower so the things in my opinion that will make you fall asleep slower is things like relationships work the to-do list what you have to do tomorrow because then you have to like think about these things the best thing to think about when going to sleep is fantasy it's it's to think about something that is not real so this works so well for me because as i've said in my previous videos i was very addicted to video games so i am being completely honest for around all of my teenage years i went to bed every single night with this thought in my mind okay what i'm going to do next on which game i was playing what i was going to do next on runescape on minecraft on league of legends is that's it then i would think okay so what i'm going to do next on runescape is i'm going to do this quest because i want to unlock this sword and then i want to be able to fight this person and i want to be able to get this level what i want to do on minecraft is oh we were on this server and i i'm pretty sure i killed someone i caught his diamond armor or what i'm going to do next on league of legends is try and get to gold five rank i'm gonna i might play with lee sin i might play with malphite thinking about fantasy means that you're not thinking about real life and fantasy makes you fall asleep easier than sleeping pills and in fact i've just stole that line i remember reading i think it was like a comment on reddit or something like that was completely random but someone literally just commented saying that reading a fantasy fiction book just before bedtime was better than sleeping pills it makes sense i think if you're watching my channel you're into self-improvement you probably are also into self-improvement books and i am as well and i think those are the wrong ones to be reading at night time so i haven't tried this already because the fantasy the fantasy game thing works for me and you know what's interesting this is kind of off topic but it was not too long ago maybe about two weeks ago i haven't played any of these games for years and i literally just wanted to experiment i went to bed and i thought okay what i'm gonna do next on runescape is and i started remembering like what was my old account like what level did i have and like okay if i was like really playing this game what would i do next i fell asleep like instantly i don't remember the rest of the thought pattern because i must have fallen asleep within just like three minutes of trying this so try that for yourself there's two extra tactics there for you is like a bonus make a checklist to do lift journal for tomorrow get all of those thoughts out what do you need to do tomorrow even the smallest things get them out because then you don't need to think about it when you're going to sleep and secondly think you know what your thoughts are think about fantasy for me it was video games what i'm gonna do next on the video game i was playing for you it could be reading game of thrones before you go to bed and then just thinking about the story what you've just read that's actually a fantastic idea read or visualize something that's just not about real life because real life is pretty stressful and real life does keep you awake but fantasy lets you like fall into the dream world perfectly so there's the extra few tips i hope these all of these tips i've gave can benefit your sleep because it is as i've said pretty much one of the most important factors that we have good sleep will improve every part of your life so try and implement these techniques take care
