what's up ladies and gentlemen this is BC Bronco sellout this is your first time to my channel I welcome you make sure that you do subscribe as we drop a lot of knowledge here and help everybody out for real estate people sales people entrepreneurs men women and everybody so in this particular video I wanted to share with you because I know the majority of my audience is between the age of 17 18 and 35 the bulk of you are gonna fall into your 20s and I wanted to give you some specific advice if I was to rewind the clock to my 20 year old version self going out into the world now versus back then some changes I would make some mistakes that maybe I made and how I can help you okay the first thing I'm going to discuss is there has been a difference right even me growing up in my 20s social media was there but nothing like it is now so you have an abundance of opportunity and so many more options compared to what I had or people before me it's a lot more acceptable now to be less politically correct to have tattoos and you know it's cool to be an entrepreneur now and not go to college so you're not gonna deal with as many social pressures you can say as my generation another one before it because even though people are still very snow flaky people are still very sensitive it's not as bad if you tell people now you don't want to go to college you don't get the whole society backlash like you did before there's a little less resistance they're okay with that save you have more opportunity and you have to have that in mind alright and I want to start with that because a lot of people will go and look on social media now who were younger maybe early twenties teens early teens late teens and again messages like this all the time saying man my life is over you know you have a Lamborghini you're doing this and I don't have anything and they tell me they're 15 or 16 years old and I kind of feel bad because social media has made the world so much smaller that you know that one billionaire in Bugatti sorry in Dubai that has ten Bugattis you would have never seen before and now you can go on YouTube and type in Bugatti and you'll see million so it's become more regular and it seems as if everybody has a Lamborghini and Bugatti and now it's created this delusion that people feel like oh and I'm never gonna have it and this whole comparison thing started well I am behind there ahead and that's the kind of the first thing I want to bust for you in your mind is you need to immediately **stop comparing yourself** to other people you have your own route your own journey draw some inspiration from others you it's okay to admire some other people and for them and their accomplishments than what they've done or maybe some skills they've acquired however you can't belittle yourself in the process and say man that guy has a Bugatti and he's you know 35 I'm 20 I don't have a penny to my name I'm a failure no it's not like that okay social media used it as a form of inspiration but also don't look at it as some limiting factor saying all these people already have this I don't have anything chill take a deep breath and understand that you need to go out there in life and experiment might try out different careers me getting into real estate it took after I finished playing basketball my professional career it took you know a year and a half two years roughly to decide on real estate I was out there interviewing at jobs checking stuff out working little side gigs and none of it clicked until I found real estate that's it this is it so with that said there has to be a little bit less research and watching and more action in you experiencing and life shadowing people working for somebody else getting your beak wet in these different avenues to say okay this is for me this isn't for me and whatever you choose you go all-in don't worry about who's already established don't worry about all this guys already built a huge company this and that again the whole comparison thing has to be thrown out the window and you need to just focus in on what you want to do once you choose and find the right career which like I said it's gonna take experimentation get out there and try stop being so oh don't do what your friend does just because he's your friend go out and experiment for yourself everybody has their own unique abilities strengths weaknesses try something out man try something out get out there live life you may fail you may have challenges normal right and then when you find the right thing you'll know just like when I found real estate even though I'm not passionate about it I knew it was the right vehicle to help me get to where I wanted to get and to create the life that I've created okay and you will do the same trust and let go let go what does I need to know I didn't know you'll find out you would let go release that internal resistance okay now tie it to the first thing which was a which is what I want to talk about now you have to immediately pull yourself out of this race it's always Oh someone so got a new car oh so and so did this someone so did that I see it a lot in the car community where it's oh how quickly can I one-up the next guy oh he got a Ferrari I'm gonna get a well he got a four or five eight I'm gonna get a 488 oh he got a Lamborghini Huracan I'm gonna get an Aventador and one-up him it becomes this ego battle - who has the next best shiny object okay you have to get yourself ahead of that race you need to understand that life is long-term it doesn't matter who gets the car first you're on your own journey build wealth build some sort of stability financial stability for yourself and those around you if you have people to take care of and know that this is a marathon not a sprint a lot of people get into this thing thinking it's a sprint a lot of the you see on social media is a lot of people that claim they have multi-millions and it's so easy and peachy are full of right I'm in one through the last couple years to share out my channel that I up a lot of struggles warning people hey you get into real estate entrepreneurship it's not easy it's gonna be a lot of work and you can achieve success but it's not gonna be easy and that's one of the main reasons on every video I'm not flashing you know my homes and the Lamborghinis and all that because I don't need to right I'll show it a little bit to inspire people or more because it shows my personal connection with the goal that I set out and me accomplishing it but it's nothing you know it's not this over-the-top thing so understand that for you it's the long game it's not the short game it's the long game if your friend or somebody who started with have some more success than you upfront or they get ahead and they start making more money before you do it's okay years let go who the are you trying to impress anyway the 10,000 people who follow you on Instagram who don't even know you or care about you or only follow you because you have some sort of status and value because at the end of the day that's what it is it's all about value ladies and gentlemen especially if you're a man if you have a lot of value meaning you have money you have power you have Fame that's why people follow you you could be the same exact person it but without any of that and to the outside their perception you can have zero value they won't follow or care they'll be on to the next person so understand that okay you can't use a following to help you grow to help you grow your business of course but don't be so attached and this is the next key so attached to I need followers I need views it doesn't matter look at my YouTube channel I have over a hundred thousand subscribers and I get what two or three thousand views per video cool I'd like to get more views of course but I'm not sitting here crying on my pillowcase every night I don't care if people are getting valued from my videos and my programs from our products in my life which I know they are because of all the messages that I get good that's all that matters I can improve my business and I'm always striving to be better of course but as I'm not so attached to it that a video comes out and I get no views I'm depressed for a week no it's not like that it's just a part of the process okay I have a complete detachment from everything which is a lesson you can learn from this you can have all the cars and homes and financial all the success you want but don't be attached to it there can't be this extreme emotional attachment you could take all my shit away from me everything and I'll be okay you know why because I know I can have it back and more no problem straight up that's what you need to get to it's great to be psyched up and go after goals but you'll notice even if for you watching you remember the last time you set a goal it was great when you got it and you were happy but did it not did the excitement not wane after a while did you not suddenly become dissatisfied again and you wanted the next thing and the next thing and the next thing that's the beautiful part it's a double-edged sword about being a human being is you have this relentless drive but when you get what you want it's like okay what's the next thing same thing for you guys getting girls remember that grow you want it for a year six months and you finally got her how did you feel after being with her for a couple months and sleeping with her a lot spending a lot of time with her right and though this is some raw and some people might be like whoa it's true then you were looking for the next one you we're not as satisfied as you were in the beginning when you were chasing her right same thing with cars and houses and monetary success and getting the trophies or whatever it is that you want eventually that goes away and you're on to the next on to the next so recognize that the lack of attachment to it meaning oh I have to have it if I don't have it I'm dead mm-hmm it's not I'm happy once I get it I'm happy while I'm there I'm happy when I get it and I'm happy after that's gonna help you tremendously tremendously that lack of attachment okay it's very very easy to say and harder to demonstrate especially in the beginning when you're hustling and maybe you don't have a lot of money and you do have some sort of pressure on you because of bills and financial responsibilities it's okay you will figure it out okay next piece of advice I'm gonna give you okay now with social media we see a huge influx of different gurus and mentors this and that I'm going to give you again this whole video is just my opinions right I'm here just to entertain right what do I know but there's been a big push lately on multiple streams of income which in itself is not bad however people who first do not have a strong one source of income are spreading themselves too thin this is what I mean about that whatever you choose to do let's say you want to be a realtor like I was when I started okay or whatever it is build a strong foundation with that before you start attempting to spread yourself into ten things and get multiple streams of income I didn't create my second stream of income until I was probably about three years into real estate roughly now I have a ton now I have seven or eight which is great but that one was a solid foundation and it made me a lot of money multiple six figures hey before I even started hustling to get another one that gave me a thousand or two thousand dollars a month which is what it'll be in the beginning okay you need to build that strong foundation with whatever it is now you have to pick the right thing if you go into work for yourself and you're an entrepreneur you're a real-estate person which is basically a business owner or an entrepreneur to some sort of sales job whatever it is build that strong build that foundation super super super deep and strong from there then do it okay there's too much focus on and this is kind of tied to this point I want to build all this passive residual income and then there's no focus on your active income look if you're ten or sorry fifteen twenty thirty forty heaven even fifty you have plenty of time to keep working why don't we focus so much on passive residual income which is great in itself I'm not saying it's not but we need to focus and put just as much time energy if not twice as much into active income why not get our active and come through the roof then that's going to become infinitely easier now to build our passive and residual income because you can create products and you know subscription groups for yourself you know that you make money on and you teach people you can purchase stocks you can purchase real estate some long-term investments by increasing your active income more and faster and stronger right that's the whole point the second step of passive residual becomes much easier when we start building this active income very very strong very very solid ok now again you're gonna have a gazillion different people telling you different stuff okay I'm giving you from my personal experience and what I think is really gonna help you especially for those of you who follow me who are somewhere in your 20s or late teens getting started okay this is the route that I took and it helped me a lot alright tied to some of the earlier points is don't worry about all the fancy the Lambos and all that stuff that's all beautiful to have but in the beginning when you get those earnings you reinvest them back into yourself and your business so you can start scaling more and more you can start buying more investments and creating more passive residual income then then you can get all this without any problem okay now tied to that is going to be that you learn about money number one and to have a very solid strong unbreakable the management system now I'm going to link here in the cards and at the end screen my broke 2 millionaire series and in one of those videos and the whole series is great by the way I recommend you watch every video but I give a very simple money management system that will help you build long term wealth you know living on a percentage of your income saving 10% for education 10% for long term investment that's going to help you tremendously I used to be terrible with money so can get better I used to be terrible mainly because of my beliefs and how I was raised however following that money management system will change your financial life and your life period I think it's 87% of people don't even have $2,000 in their checking account that's sad not even 87 percent of people here in America that's said so you got to get your money right ladies and gentlemen you've got to get your money right financial management system okay now I'm gonna go over one more point and this is something I specialize in and then I'll in the video and I probably will be continuing this there's a series and I may even talk about this the 20s era and a lot of my interviews because some of the friends that I have who have established wealth or not in their 20s anymore and they can impart a lot of wisdom on you as far as mistakes that were made okay this is the last one this is what I specialize in it's not the most popular however they will determine ultimately how high you get up in the ranks and that's your mindset we need to understand that we live in a mental universe ladies and gentlemen shout out to a roach and i MC it's all in a state of mind it is all in a state of mind my ability to make my mind says stronger build my confidence and be unbreakable on the inside has what has been the biggest factor in my success in my continued success as far as outside of just real estate speaking gigs new relationships I've made other opportunities has been all because of my mindset you've all been in places where you're broken down mentally you're crying you have no confidence well imagine if you could less than that and practically completely eliminated so your unbreakable so that 90% of the time 95% of the time you're strong in you're confident and you're only vulnerable this amount of the time not five percent confident 95% vulnerable and scared right how many of you live with anxiety fear uncertainty what if you could eliminate that well working on your mindset building your confidence and building all these strategical mental tools will get you there okay now that's a constant conquest of knowledge studying the right people developing yourself right I've studied a ton of people Jim Rome Anthony Robbins Brian Tracy Tom Hopkins I mean you name it Robert Greene who wrote the 48 laws of power the art of seduction mastery and all those other books all those titles I mean I'm a constant student of the game of communication of the mind studying NLP studying hypnosis get well first you have to learn sales of course that goes with it and I might even talk about that here at the end a little bit but your mind is your best friend or your worst enemy now if you're serious about improving yourself and you would like some help with it I do offer a program on my website called modern success and we focus a lot on the mind we also focus on sales and other stuff but that's in the description if you're interested okay focus is on the money now the last thing I'm gonna focus on is sales if you learn how to sell on the highest level you will be a fantastic communicator you will always be needed in an economy and three you will always make more money than the average person that's for sure because sales is a skill I don't care if you're introvert I don't care if you're a man or a woman what religion you're from what skin color you have it doesn't matter if you can sell you can sell period that is a language of money it is a language of influence it is a language of persuasion and sales skills will take you much farther than just working behind a computer or being somebody who's transactional meeting and working behind a desk if you're working behind a cashier you know a register whatever it is now if you're working that to make money more power to you however your ability to sell will take you very very far learning basic sales skills you can learn on YouTube you can learn from me plenty of people out there to now begin to study to hone your craft okay now I don't want to make this video too long we're already at about 17 minutes and I will end it here I will probably start zooming in on certain topics here and giving them to you again but understand if you follow this basic advice and you get into action A-C-T-I-O-N and action you will be much more successful than the average person okay it's great to study it's great to learn for me and other people however you have to put it into action okay so that's it for this one ladies and gentlemen leave a comment below if you made it here to the end and what you liked about the video anything you'd like to add if maybe you're not in your 20s or in your late 20s and you have some advice for the
