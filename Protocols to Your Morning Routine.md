# Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman: "You Will Feel The Benefits Immediately"

- Write down the time you wake up - establish your average "temperature minimum" ~2hrs before waking. Try to wake up at the same time regardless of what time you went to sleep.
- Take a walk (forward ambulation) - visual images pass by our eyes and quiets activity in the amygdala. Natural sunlight stimulates neurons which signals the brain to be alert and bumps cortisol.
- Drink water - sometimes add a little sea salt. Promotes "ionic flow" in our neurons. Wait for and hour or two before drinking coffee. Caffeine blocks adenosine buildup which could cause you to crash in the afternoon
- Fast in the morning - increase adrenaline levels which allows us to focus and learn better
- Exercise an hour a day - cardio & weight training. Take a recovery day on the weekend.
